## Lesson Summary:

This lesson introduces NumPy and package imports in general. It explains some of the backstory to pip and also shows students the autoreload extension, working with students to organize their functions in a seperate .py file and import them into a jupyter notebook.

#### Topic:
NumPy and Intro to Packages


#### Learning goals:
- Identify and import Python libraries
- Identify differences between NumPy and base Python in usage and operation
- Create a new library of our own


#### Prerequisite knowledge

* Familiarity with navigating Jupyter notebooks
* Understanding of dot notation

#### Misconceptions:
Potential confusion with namespaces and various import syntax.  
For example the differences in the following and how to subsequently access those subsequent imports:  
```python
import numpy as np
#versus
import numpy
#versus
from numpy import *
#versus
from numpy import sum
```

* Resetting kernel

#### Materials

Student facing jupyter notebook
